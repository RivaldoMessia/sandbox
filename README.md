# Objective:
The goal of this project is to predict crop yield using the given dataset. This project aims to develop skills in regression analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

# Project Overview:
In this project, we will analyze a dataset containing various factors that influence crop yield. Our main tasks are to:

1.	Predict Crop Yield: Build a predictive model to estimate crop yield based on features such as rainfall, temperature, fertilizer usage, and macro nutrients.
2.	Feature Impact Analysis: Identify and analyze the variables that most significantly impact crop yield.
3.	Recommendation : Provide suggestions and recommendations based on your analysis and findings for the firm.

# Dataset Description:
The Crop Yield Prediction dataset includes the following features:

●	Rainfall (mm): Amount of rainfall in millimeters.
●	Temperature (C): Temperature conditions during the farming period in Celsius.
●	Fertilizer (kg): Representing the quantity or concentration of fertilizer applied in kilograms.
●	Nitrogen (N): Amount of nitrogen present in the fertilizer or soil (macro nutrient)
●	Phosphorous (P):Amount of phosphorus present in the fertilizer or soil (macro nutrient).
●	Potassium (K): Amount of potassium present in the fertilizer or soil (macro nutrient).
●	Yield (Q/acres): Crop yield in quintals per acre.
●	Crop type : the type of crop produced ie, sorghum, corn, wheat etc
